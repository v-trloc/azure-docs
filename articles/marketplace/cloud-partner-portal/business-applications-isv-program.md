# Microsoft Business Applications Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Connect Program onboarding guide

The [Business Applications ISV Connect Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/isv-overview) aims to accelerate the growth and overall success of Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) building modern, cloud-based, line-of-business (LOB) solutions with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement and PowerApps (Dynamics CE applications) or Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (Dynamics Ops applications). 

To enroll and take advantage of all the technical, marketing, and sales enablement benefits of the Business Applications ISV Connect Program, complete the following sections in this article. 

**Important:** It is necessary to complete all the steps in this article before publishing changes to a new or existing offer.

This article provides all the steps to create a new account as well as information on adding new publishers to the commercial marketplace program.

**Note:** This step requires an *Owner* or *Manager* role in Partner Center.

## 2. Accept the Business Applications ISV Program Addendum

Participation in this program requires you to review and accept the [Business Applications Addendum](http://aka.ms/bizappsisvaddendum).

2.	Select **Settings** (gear icon) and select **Developer Settings**.

4.	Select the version link and view the agreement.
5.	To agree and accept the agreement, select **Accept Agreement**.

2.	Select **Settings** (gear icon) and select **Developer Settings**.

**Note:** You can update your billing profile at any time. However, *Company Name* and billing address *Country* cannot be changed later.

## 4. Publish and certify your application

After you have completed the steps above, your existing Dynamics 365 CE and/or Dynamics 365 Ops applications will be available for editing in the Partner Center. You will also have the option to create new applications.

The final step for enrollment in the Business Applications ISV Connect program is to publish and certify your existing applications. To publish and certify your application to AppSource, follow the appropriate link:
